BinauralPlayer's user directory namings changed.

Please move all presets saved under 
~/Documents/BinauralPlayer/presets/ directory to ~/Documents/BinauralPlayer/brainwave-presets/

and likewise

all ambient nature  music files from 
~/Documents/BinauralPlayer/ambient/    to ~/Documents/BinauralPlayer/ambient-tracks/

Then you may delete the 'presets' and 'ambient' directories as they are no longer needed.
